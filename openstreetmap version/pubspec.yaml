# You must manually modify the code for reportsSummaryGetWithHttpInfo in this file to add the type=json query parameter.

# Important: Because this is an AUTO-GENERATED FILE, this change will be overwritten every time you run dart pub run build_runner build. You must remember to re-apply this fix after every code generation.

# Here is the precise modification for reports_api.dart and a reminder of the other critical fixes needed across your codebase.


# Change in lib/src/generated_api/api/reports_api.dart
# Locate the reportsSummaryGetWithHttpInfo method and add the line queryParams.add(QueryParam('type', 'json')); after the from and to parameters are added.

# queryParams.addAll(_queryParams('', 'from', from));
#     queryParams.addAll(_queryParams('', 'to', to));

#     // 🔥 CRITICAL FIX: Add the 'type=json' query parameter to force JSON response
#     // This should finally resolve the 'PK' FormatException.
#     queryParams.add(QueryParam('type', 'json')); 

#     const contentTypes = <String>[];


# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.
